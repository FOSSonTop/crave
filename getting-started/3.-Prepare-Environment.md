# Getting Started 
## How to Prepare Environment
1. Now head on over to [foss.crave.io](https://Foss.crave.io)
and press the Downloads button in the Left Hand Side menu to download `crave.conf` file

2. Now open up your browser again and navigate back to foss.crave.io
dashboard. On the same Left Hand Side menu, and go to API keys.

Create a new one, name it whatever you like to easily identify it and
click on Create API Key Button.

Now, download this newly created API key and copy it over to your crave
folder, wherever it is. On linux, preferably put it in your home
directory, or wherever your terminal leads you when you first open it.

3. Finally, to enter Devspace CLI: simply run

```
crave devspace
```
